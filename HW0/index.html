<h2>Simon</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Original game is Simon from Phaser 2 examples. Player needs to memorize the order of the flashing squares, and repeat that order.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For my game, player need to memorize the order, but repeat in the reverse order. Since the order is decided at the beginning of the game, and the count the player needs to memorize will increse by 1 for each turn, it makes the game harder than original game in an adequate level.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype, I learned basic knowledge of Phaser 2, and the ability to read others code from Phaser 2. The easiest thing is modifying this prototype model in brain, and the hardest part is to understanding the whold code and change the algorithm (which only require a few lines change, but cost too much time to understand and design the algorithm). The other hard thing is adding music into the game (I didn't complete that, and instead of that, I add audio as the background music for this html, where the game will be played).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The image asset is made with Microsoft Excel by meself, and the audio asset is from Amazon.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Simon is the fundamention of my game.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A click memory game that easy to start, but hard to be expert.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The sequence of flashing is random, and the game only uses some self-made imagines (and I made the game looks better than original one). The play style is repeating of memorize and reappear a fixed order. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Flashing the squares and collect the click and compare with right answer.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
No game experience needed. The only thing the player needed is know how to click an indicated part of the scren.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This game works based on watch-memory-repeat cycle. Player needs to watch the order of square flashing, and memorize the order, and then repeat it in a reverse order (original is the orginal order). Players should memorize the order with the help of previous rounds, and sometimes, fortune will help make up the memory.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Skill of memory is important for that game. The player will need to memorize more and more elements with the game, how to build memory based on established memory and don't mess them up are important.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is just watch, memory and repeat game and doesn't have a world. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Target for all range people, especially who wants to exercise their memory.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It's easy to start by just look at the screen. For fresh player, it may only take a few second of 1 or 2 minutes before they lose, but for senior player, it can also take a long time to play because the longest sequence is set to 200.
